#### About Insight
Insight is a mobile app designed to help keep students up to date with a school's latest information. I made Insight for Poway High School during the 2019-2020 academic year. Unfortunately, I was never able to publish the project on the App Store or Google Play Store due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic cutting the year short.

Insight was made in C# with Unity3D.

#### Features
Boasting a clean, responsive UI, Insight enables students to keep track of all the most pertinent information, including:
* Week-At-A-Glance
* Customizable Month-To-Month Calendar
* Announcement Feed
* Staff Directory and School Info
* Instagram Notifications for Clubs

#### Development
I developed Insight while working closely with my school's principal over the course of about five months. During this time, I held regular meetings with the principal to get an idea of what features he would like to see in the app, as well as get feedback on design decisions.

Insight interfaces with various third-party APIs, such as Apple's push notification service, Google Firebase, Google Calendar, the and Instagram graph API.
