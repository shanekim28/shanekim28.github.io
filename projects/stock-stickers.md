#### About Stock Stickers

How can you tell if it's a good time to buy or sell stocks? Stock Stickers is a mobile app that helps investors make better decisions.

#### Features

- Search and save symbols to your watchlist
- Calculate retail price of a stock
- Compare market price vs. sticker price

#### Development

Stock Stickers was my first freelance project for a client on [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/u/shanekim28). I designed, programmed, and published the app in its entirety, save for the logo. I developed Stock Stickers using Xamarin.Forms for its cross-compatibile features.
