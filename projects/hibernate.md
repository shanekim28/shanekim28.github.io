#### About Hibernate
Hibernate is a mobile app to designed to help you get a full night's rest. I was inspired to make this app by the [sleepyti.me](https://www.sleepyti.me) static webpage.

Hibernate was made in C# with Xamarin.Forms.

<div style="overflow: hidden">
{% include gallery.html image="projects/hibernate/home.png" desc="Home" %}
{% include gallery.html image="projects/hibernate/1.png" desc="Wake up time" %}
{% include gallery.html image="projects/hibernate/2.png" desc="Bedtime"%}
</div>

#### Features
Hibernate has a straightforward, calming UI to calculate the best amount of sleep you should be getting. It features two main pages:
* Wake up calculator
* Bedtime calculator

#### Development
I develeoped Hibernate over the course of a day as a way to practice Xamarin.Forms, which I had been learning for the last few months. This project serves as a quick checkpoint in my Xamarin learning process, and allows me to assess what I've done and where I should go from here.
