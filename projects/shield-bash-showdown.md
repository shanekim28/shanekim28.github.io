#### About Shield Bash Showdown
Shield Bash Showdown is a fast-paced singleplayer arena survival game. I made Shield Bash Showdown in just 48 hours in summer of 2018. Having just missed the registration deadline for the Ludum Dare Game Jam by a few days, I reasoned that one doesn't need a game jam to incentivize finishing a project. 

Shield Bash Showdown was made in C# with Unity3D.

#### Game Objective
The goal of Shield Bash Showdown is to survive as long as possible. Enemies spawn in random locations periodically, and each enemy has a cannon that shoots projectiles at varying rates of fire.

The best offense is a good defense. Use your shield to absorb projectiles to increase your power level. Higher power allows you to move faster and charge up your shield bash attack faster. Keep an eye on your power level! If it gets too high, you will die from being unable to contain it.

The game ends when you lose your lives. You have up to two lives, and can get one back by killing more enemies.

#### Development
As mentioned earlier, I made Shield Bash Showdown in C# with Unity3D. All models and animations were made in Blender. Music and sound effects were made in FL Studio. The entire development process was recorded, but I still have yet to edit the raw footage and post it online.
