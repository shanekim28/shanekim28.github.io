### Introduction

Many moons ago, I had purchased the game Gunpoint on Steam. As a musician, I was delighted to hear the original sound track was all jazz, my favorite genre. I made a mental note of the game's designers, after which they slowly faded from memory, never to be heard again. Or so I thought.
Two years ago as I was browsing YouTube, I saw a familiar name: Tom Francis. He had a video series from six years ago entitled GHGC, short for what I presume is "Grappling Hook Game Concept." From this video series, I was inspired to create my own grappling hook game concept.
I spent about a week trying to recreate Mr. Francis' grappling hook, and eventually gave up after a lot of trial and error. My logical thinking skills and patience were simply not there. Eventually I returned to the topic, and the light of God shined upon me, unlocking my true potential to complete that concept. The result was... fine. It wasn't anything especially special and had some bugs, but it still felt pretty darn good to use. 
However, I wasn't interested in making 2D games, so I tried to extend my concept into three dimensions. Again, I attempted for about a week, and again, I failed and gave it up. The project was left unfinished until I revisited it just this past week and finally brought my concept into fruition. All that was to say that I've been experimenting with this off and on for a while and someone needs to appreciate my incredible hard work and dedication.
