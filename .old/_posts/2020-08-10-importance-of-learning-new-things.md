#### Here We Go Again...

It feels like it doesn't need to be said, but we all need to be reminded once in a while. Learning new things is so crucial to one's growth not only as a tradesman in the working world, but also as a human being.

#### Knowledge is Power

As an incoming college freshman, there's a lot of things that I don't know how to do yet, like how to get a girlfriend :(

But really, ignorance truly is my greatest enemy. Since I'm not familiar with each software industry (e.g. mobile app development, backend development), I have no idea what I want to pursue. If I don't know what I want to do, how am I supposed to know which skills I should be building? That's why learning as much as possible is so important, especially for a young college student like me.

#### We're Going on an Adventure!

SARS-CoV-2 was a blessing as well as a curse. When the shelter-in-place order was given, I was completely lost and without purpose. School was cancelled. However, as summer dragged on, I realized the quarantine created the perfect environment for learning a new skill. So, that's exactly what I did. 

Over the course of about a month, I decided to expand my horizons. I studied REST APIs and the SOLID design principles, which I had never even heard of until now. I improved my C# skills by purchasing an e-book and creating a web API in ASP.NET MVC. This taste of backend was surprisingly enjoyable. It felt viscerally OOP, like I was truly designing architecture.

After I felt like I had learned the basics, I moved on. Up until recently, I had been using Unity3D to make my apps. Don't get me wrong, Unity is great, but it's better suited for some things than others. App development is not really one of them. So, I picked up Xamarin.Forms (are you seeing the .NET trend yet?). After feeling what Xamarin is like, I've decided I'm not a fan of mobile development. It feels like you're wrestling an alligator on an airplane, all while the airplane is on fire and about to crash and oh no the alligator has a shotgun now.

But that's okay! Thanks to all these new experiences, both good and bad, I'm one step closer to knowing what I want to pursue as a career path. Realizing that mobile development kind of sucks was an epiphanic moment for me, leading me to greater understanding of what I might want to do with my life.

#### Everything is Connected in the Strangest Ways

We should always be looking to learn new things. I sat in my comfort zone for too long. I forgot what it felt like to have a fresh start; to learn something completely new. It may feel like a drag at times, but it's completely worth it.

Although I'm nowhere close to being an expert on backend software, the things I learned from my adventures in ASP.NET could still be applied to my explorations in Xamarin. This is why we should strive to always be learning. As we broaden our knowledge, we also expand our opportunities. If we allow ourselves to explore, we can apply knowledge from seemingly unrelated sources, which leads to greater creativity.
